3. Create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder with the following content:
   ```
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
   EMAIL_USER=your_gmail@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASS=your_16_char_gmail_app_password
   JWT_SECRET=your_custom_secret
   ```
   - **EMAIL_PASS**: Generate a 16-character App Password from https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
   - **Do NOT use your normal Gmail password!**

## 6. Using the App
1. **Register** with your email and password.
2. **Check your email** for a verification link and click it.
3. **Log in** with your verified email and password.
4. **Upload a transcript** and enter a prompt (or leave blank for default summary).
5. **Edit the summary** if needed.
6. **Share the summary** via email (enter recipient emails, separated by commas).

## Troubleshooting
- If you do not receive verification emails:
  - Double-check your `.env` settings, especially `EMAIL_USER` and `EMAIL_PASS`.
  - Make sure you are using a Gmail App Password, not your normal password.
  - Check your spam/junk folder.
  - Try sending a test email using the provided `test-email.js` script.
- If the backend server crashes, check the terminal for error messages and fix any issues with your `.env` or dependencies.

---

## Notes
- For production, use a real database and a production email provider.
- Keep your `.env` file secure and never commit it to public repositories.
